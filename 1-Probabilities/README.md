# A_coin_probability.py

## 	There are three functions in Probability_A class

​		**Toss_A_Coin**: Receive the probability to return *true*. It receives the probability param that needs to have a value between 0 and 1 to return *true* or *false* (1 or 0)

​		**Frequency**: It's receive an list of zeros and ones to respond with a probability to find a one in this list. This function returns a float with a value between 0 and 1 

​		**Experiment**: This function is the main experiment from this class. It receives the probability to use the Toss_A_Coin function and the number of chances that the coin will be toss. It return a list of results of zeros and ones.

## 	These functions are tested with Test Class. 

​		When this script runs, Test Class runs too. Actually,  this script is to be imported by another script to use the Probability_A_class. So, if you run this script, you will just test it and see if it's ok to use.
